-Change around for date time ✓
-Inheritance, same thing but adding extra on top. Needs to behave differently.
-Prove that it's needed. Client specific, less general.
-Makes sense for a desktop app, analyse each event and give a summary afterwards. e.g "How long you spent doing x" (allows for linear search asw)
-Add simple charting (if possible). (inheritance through how it is shown e.g bar graph, table etc.)
-Series of fixed categories in event class.
-NEXT: calendar log between database and events, arraylist of all events and method for adding and deleting stuff, move from database to calendar log.
    -GUI component straight away ✓
    -Add new events/ see existing events. ✓
    -Simple jframe form that lets someone select a date, see events on that date, or add new events to that date
    -something to render month (possible widget?)
    -database reads it back in
    -plus stats/ histogram
    -Linear search through database for everything that matches that month, sort after. (can write about how it won't run out of memory because only a month's worth is loaded at a time).

    -FOR CRITERION B COULD SOMEONE ELSE DESIGN BASED OFF MY DESCRIPTION
